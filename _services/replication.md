# Objectives

Our objective with the Replication service is to provide our clients with a resilient and highly available infrastructure that ensures continuous operation of their critical workloads. We aim to:

1. **Ensure Business Continuity**: Enable businesses to maintain uninterrupted operation of their services by replicating virtual machines to different geographic locations, ensuring geo redundancy and resilience against localized outages or disasters.
2. **Minimize Downtime**: Minimize downtime and data loss with incremental replication techniques and continuous synchronization, ensuring that replicated VMs are always up to date with the latest changes and ready for failover at any moment.
3. **Facilitate Disaster Recovery**: Serve as a cornerstone of our clients' disaster recovery strategy, providing automatic failover capabilities in the event of a zone failure or outage, and ensuring seamless recovery and business continuity.
4. **Optimize Resource Utilization**: Employ efficient replication strategies to minimize bandwidth usage and optimize replication efficiency, ensuring that replication operations are fast, efficient, and minimally disruptive to the network infrastructure.
5. **Enhance Data Resilience**: Enhance data resilience and availability by spreading workloads across multiple zones, providing geo redundancy and resilience against localized outages or disasters, and ensuring that critical workloads remain protected and accessible to users at all times.

With these objectives in mind, our Replication service is tailored to meet the diverse needs of businesses across industries, offering peace of mind and confidence in the availability and resilience of their critical workloads.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

| Service Component        | Details                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Replication Schedule     | Daily at 02:00                                              |
| Retained Increments      | 2 increments retained to provide a minimal rollback window  |

## Incremental Replication

Our Replication service employs incremental replication techniques to minimize bandwidth usage and optimize replication efficiency. By only transferring the changes made since the last replication, we ensure that replication operations are fast, efficient, and minimally disruptive to your network infrastructure.

## Geo Redundancy

With our Replication service, your VMs are replicated to different geographic locations, providing geo redundancy and resilience against localized outages or disasters. By spreading your workload across multiple zones, we ensure that your services remain available and accessible to your users at all times.

## Disaster Recovery

Our Replication service plays a crucial role in your disaster recovery strategy. In the event of a zone failure or outage, our system automatically fails over to the replicated VMs in another zone, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity. With our Replication service, you can rest assured that your critical workloads are protected and recoverable in any scenario.

## Continuous Replication

We offer continuous replication capabilities to ensure that your replicated VMs are always up to date with the latest changes. By continuously synchronizing data between zones, we eliminate the risk of data loss and ensure that your failover process is seamless and transparent to your users.

> At CyberSpace, we take pride in delivering reliable and comprehensive replication solutions that prioritize the availability and resilience of your critical workloads. With our Replication service, you can have peace of mind knowing that your data and services are protected and accessible whenever you need them.
