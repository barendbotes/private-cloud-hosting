# Objectives

Our objective with the Self Service Portal is to empower users to efficiently provision, manage, and scale resources within the confines of their allocated resources. We aim to:

1. **Enhance User Experience**: Provide an easy-to-use interface that simplifies resource provisioning and management, catering to both technical and non-technical users.
2. **Ensure Resource Isolation**: Limit access to resources to ensure that users can only manage their allocated resources, maintaining security and compliance.
3. **Accelerate Deployment**: Offer VM deployment templates to streamline the deployment process, enabling users to quickly spin up new VM instances without manual configuration.
4. **Facilitate Resource Management**: Provide a Resource Dashboard to enable users to monitor resource usage and performance, empowering them to optimize resource allocation and utilization.

Our Self Service Portal is designed to streamline resource management workflows, enhance productivity, and promote self-sufficiency within your organization, enabling you to focus on your core business activities with confidence.

## Easy to Use

## Limited to Your Own Resources

The Self Service Portal provides users with access only to their allocated resources, ensuring strict adherence to resource allocation policies and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data or infrastructure components.

## VM Deployment Templates

Streamline the process of VM deployment with our pre-configured templates. Choose from a variety of templates tailored to different use cases, eliminating the need for manual configuration and reducing deployment time.

## Resource Dashboard

Stay informed about your resource usage and performance with our Resource Dashboard. Monitor CPU, memory, and storage utilization in real-time, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and optimization.
